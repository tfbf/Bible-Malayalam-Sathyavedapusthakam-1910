Sathyavedapusthakam Revised Orthography Edition
===================

This repository contains source of The Holy Bible translation into
Malayalam language known as `Sathyavedapusthakam published by The
British and Foreign Bible Society in 1910
<https://archive.org/details/Sathyavedapusthakam_1910>`_.  The source
text is formatted using `USFM <http://paratext.org/about/usfm>`_ markup.
The text can be converted to other formats using USFM converters.

The revised orthography version is an attempt to modernize the orthography and also the text. The changes introduced in the text can be checked by comparing it with the master branch. A comparison of the text with the current version of the SVP is also included in the 1910ro/changes folder.
